# RESUME APP
## DESCRIPTION OF THE APP
This application is a mobile version of my resume, it displays my picture, name, some information about me, what i can offer, experiences, education, skills and certifications. The app has a dark and light mode and a user can switch using a toggle button. The app has 2 screens apart from the spash screen making it a total of 3 screens; the first screen with basic information and a button below will take you to the next screen with more information. The app has social media links like twitter, facebook and linkedin and if a user should tap on those icons, it will take the user to my social media profile url. The app is responsive and user friendly.

## DESCRIPTION OF CODE BASE
The code base is structured to have a folder which i named screens containing all the screens in the app, and another folder that i named utils containing other classes i used in the implementation of this app. The screens folder has 3 dart files which are splash_screen, home_screen and more_info_screen while the utils folder has 4 dart files which i named strings, styles, theme_shared_prefrence and themeModel. The styles folder contains all the text styling and colors used in the app and i call them in my code whenever i need them. The string file contains only the long texts used on the app. The theme_shared_prefrence and themeModel files were part of what I used for the implementation of my dark/light mode.

## DESCRIPTION OF DESIGN
I came up with the design myself. Its a very simple, clean, user friendly yet unique design. The first screen that comes up after launching the app is the splash screen and then the home screen which contains the major content of the app, from there a button when tapped will take the user to the next screen with more information about the resume.

## CHALLENGES FACED AND HOW I OVERCAME
   I had challenge at first while trying to come up with a design for this app because no design was given, but i later got inspiration from different designs i have      workded on in the past and then came up with this.
   I also had a little challenge while implenting the dark mode feature, then i checked online for resources and overcame the challenge and it was a success.
